# Type 2 Diabetes & Alcohol Consumption – Synthetic Epidemiology Dataset

## Overview
This repository provides a **fully-synthetic, research-grade dataset** (15,000 participants × 39 variables) designed to explore the relationship between alcohol consumption patterns and the risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).  
It also includes reproducible analysis templates—ranging from basic descriptives to advanced causal-inference and machine-learning workflows—built in Python.

> **Why synthetic?**  
> • Removes all privacy concerns  
> • Guarantees free public use under the MIT License  
> • Preserves realistic distributions, correlations, and confounding structures found in peer-reviewed T2D epidemiology studies

## Project Goals
1. **Quantify** the dose-response (U-shaped) link between alcohol intake and T2D.  
2. **Control** for key confounders—age, BMI, ethnicity, smoking, SES, etc.  
3. **Demonstrate** modern analytical techniques: splines, propensity scores, random forests, XGBoost.  
4. **Serve** as a teaching and benchmarking resource for epidemiologists and data scientists.
