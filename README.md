# Diabetes and Alcohol Consumption: A Synthetic Data Science Project

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the relationship between alcohol consumption and the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes using **synthetically generated data**. The analysis is divided into three main notebooks:

1. **Descriptive Analysis** – Basic statistical summaries and visualizations of the synthetic dataset.
2. **Dose-Response Relationship** – Investigating how varying levels of alcohol consumption relate to diabetes risk.
3. **Multivariable Logistic Regression** – Modeling the relationship while adjusting for potential confounders.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project uses **AI-generated synthetic data**. It does **not** represent real-world clinical or epidemiological data and should not be interpreted as such. The primary purpose is for practice and demonstration as I continue learning data science.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

I began learning data science approximately **four months ago**, and this is my **first full analysis project**. It reflects the skills I've learned so far, including:

* Data cleaning and preparation
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
* Statistical modeling using `statsmodels`
* Interpreting logistic regression outputs

## 🚀 What's Next

As I continue learning, I hope to:

* Incorporate model validation and performance metrics
* Explore causal inference techniques
* Apply similar methods to real-world datasets (once I’m confident with ethical and technical aspects)
